<h1>Hi there I'm a super fresh player in Splatoon, Splatoon 2, and Splatoon 3!</h1>
<hr /> 
<h2>I think in the Splatoon story for the first game was super fun, but the story for Splatoon 2 was good it just was kind of a  repeating of the first game.</h2>

<h2>The Octo expansion made up for it, because it had a story for a new hero that wasn't an inkling it was a good differant feeling in the game!</h2>

<h2>For Splatoon 3 I'd say it was way better than all the story lines in the Splatoon series. For the story line it just gives you the feeling of excitement and I just think it really explained how the inklings and octolings became humanoid.</h2>

<h2>Side Order also was super fun like the Octo expansion, but Acht from the band Deadf1sh was in it, and Pearl is a drone I think she was made to be like a replace-ment for Smallfry.</h2>
